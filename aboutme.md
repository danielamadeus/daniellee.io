Welcome to my personal website. I graduated from the University of Miami in 2019 with a double major in Finance and Computer Science. I will pursue a Masterâ€™s in Science in Engineering in Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania beginning in fall of 2020, with a focus in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am an avid coder, programmer, and engineer. I plan to update this website to include my latest work and projects. Thanks for visiting!
